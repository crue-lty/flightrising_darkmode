# A Dark Theme For _Flight Rising_
## Now with 21% more dragon! <sup>And maybe a few corvids</sup>

[Flight Rising](https://www1.flightrising.com/) is a virtual pet game focused around dragons, and it's constantly updating, like all of the time. This is a project that takes the work of **Zoga** and brings their darkmode CSS up to date with the new additions to the site, as well as trying to improve on the pre-existing code.

Zoga's original work can be found at [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uso-archive/data/flomaster/data/usercss/150521.user.css).

Disclaimer: We have no idea what we're doing and our code is hacked together worse than Yandere Dev's. But it works!

Another disclaimer: We are not affiliated with Zoga, they are not involved in our project, and they do not endorse us. Zoga's CSS is under the CC-BY-NC-4.0 license, granting us permission to edit and redistribute their work with credit. They wrote almost all of the code that currently exists in this project, and they are very cool for that.
